This is the analysis I did on a database that holds multiple tables for an online digital media store.

#First What are the non USA based customers?

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country <> "USA";

# How many customers do we have in Brazil?

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

# What invoices including date and customer name are from our customers in Brazil?

SELECT cust.FirstName,cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerID=inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

# How many sales agents does the company have?
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

# How many countries do we sell in?

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

# How Many invoices does each sales agent have?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId
Join chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId;

# What are the invoice totals per customer, and what sales agent worked on those invoices?

SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
From chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
Join chinook.employees emp ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId;

# How many Invoices were from 2009?

SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#What is the total of the invoices from 2009?

SELECT sum(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

# What tracks were perchased on each invoice?

SELECT t.name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i ON t.TrackId=i.TrackId;

# What are the artists of the purchased tracks?

SELECT t.Name AS Track, a.Name AS Artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.artists a
JOIN chinook.albums album ON a.ArtistId=album.ArtistId
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON t.AlbumId=album.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i ON i.TrackId=t.TrackId;

# What album, media, and genre are the tracks from?

SELECT t.Name AS Track, a.Title AS Album, m.Name AS Media, g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON t.AlbumId=a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON t.MediaTypeId=m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.GenreId=t.GenreId;

# What are the total sales by each sales agent?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

# Who was the top earning sales agent in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId

WHERE emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2)) DESC LIMIT 1

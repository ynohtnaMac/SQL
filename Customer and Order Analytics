In this analasis I will be running queries to quantify sales data and statistics across multiple tables.


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT (orderID)
 FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) =6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT (*)
 FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
 AND length(orderid) =6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

Select Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price LIMIT 1

 #5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
 
 SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue,
sum(quantity), product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) =6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

#9.Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderid) = 6
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >2;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT sum(quantity) as quantity, Product 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity*price) / COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderid) = 6;

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity)/ COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderid) = 6;

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product,
sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1
